title: "Scalable Graph Topology Learning via Spectral Densification"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/WSDM21
excerpt: 'Graph learning plays important role in many data mining and machine learning tasks, such as manifold learning, data representation and analysis, dimensionality reduction, data clustering, and visualization, etc. For the first time, we present a highly-scalable spectral graph densification approach (GRASPEL) for graph learning from data. A very unique property of the graphs learned by GRASPEL is that the spectral embedding (or approximate effective-resistance) distances on the graph will encode the similarities between the original input data points.'
